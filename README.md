# LitLoom-SnW
My topic for SnW project is Book/Media library. LitLoom is a modern digital library that weaves together literature, film, music, and art into one creative platform. It offers an immersive space for readers and creators to explore stories and ideas across media, connecting imagination and inspiration through a beautifully woven digital experience.
